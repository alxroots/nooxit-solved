Hey There, I would like to express how grateful I am for having the opportunity to take on this technical challenge. It was an amazing experience, not only to showcase my work, but also to confirm that I possess valuable skills and I am capable of building amazing applications.

Although I am quite satisfied with the final result, I recognize that there are many improvements that could be implemented, such as error handling and other user messages using Notistack, and backend component isolation. However, given the relatively small size of the project in terms of backend, I opted to keep it simple.

This was my first experience with FastAPI, and although I usually work with Django, I thought it was a good opportunity to learn a new tool. I believe I did a good job in a short amount of time and learned a lot during the process.

Although the final visual result of the challenge is relatively different from what was requested, I think the project meets the purposes of the challenge and presents a viable solution to the proposed problem.

Once again, I would like to thank you for the opportunity and I hope you enjoyed my work.
